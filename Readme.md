# MOTO6809Project: A Motorola 6809 Microprocessor Simulator

## Project Overview

The MOTO6809Project is a Java-based application designed to simulate the functionality of the Motorola 6809 microprocessor. This project appears to be an educational tool or a development environment for understanding and working with the 6809 architecture. It likely provides a visual interface to interact with the microprocessor's registers, memory, and program execution flow, allowing users to write, load, and debug 6809 assembly code.

The presence of `.form` files and `.java` files for UI components (like `BAR.form`, `Memory.form`, `PROGRAMME.form`, `VALEUR.form`, `MOTO_INTERFACE.form`, `INSTRUCTION.form`) suggests a graphical user interface (GUI) application, possibly built using a Swing or AWT framework, and developed with an IDE like NetBeans (as indicated by `nbproject` directory and `Generated by NetBeans IDE` comment in `INSTRUCTION.html`).

## Key Features

Based on the file structure and names, the project likely includes the following key features:

*   **Microprocessor Simulation**: Core functionality to emulate the Motorola 6809 CPU.
*   **Register Visualization**: Display of CPU registers (PC, LSRA, S, U, A, B, DP, X, Y) and their values, as seen in the `image.png` provided previously.
*   **Memory Management**: Simulation of memory (RAM/ROM) with the ability to view and potentially modify memory contents (`Memory.java`, `ROM.java`).
*   **Assembly Code Editor/Loader**: Functionality to load and execute 6809 assembly programs (`PROGRAMME.java`).
*   **Instruction Set Execution**: Execution of 6809 instructions, with visual feedback on register and memory changes.
*   **User Interface**: A graphical interface for interaction, likely including buttons for control (e.g., run, step, reset) and visual indicators (`ICONS` directory contains `MOTO.png`, `UAL.png`, `refresh_60.png`, etc.).
*   **Instruction Set Reference**: An integrated instruction set reference or help section (`INSTRUCTION.html`, `INSTRUCTION.java`).

## Technologies Used

*   **Java**: The primary programming language for the application logic and GUI.
*   **Swing/AWT**: Likely used for building the graphical user interface components.
*   **Apache Ant**: Indicated by `build.xml`, suggesting it's used for building the Java project.
*   **NetBeans IDE**: The `nbproject` directory and comments in `INSTRUCTION.html` strongly suggest the project was developed using NetBeans.

## Project Structure

The repository has a standard Java project structure:

```

│   ├── INSTRUCTION.html  # HTML launcher for the applet
│   └── classes/          # Compiled Java .class files

### Key Directories and Files:

*   **`src/moto/`**: Contains the core Java source code for the simulator components. Files like `Memory.java`, `ROM.java`, `PROGRAMME.java`, and `MOTO_INTERFACE.java` are central to the simulation and GUI.
*   **`.form` files**: These are GUI design files, typically generated by NetBeans's GUI builder, defining the layout and components of the application's windows/panels.
*   **`build/`**: Contains the compiled `.class` files and the `INSTRUCTION.html` which serves as an applet launcher.
*   **`nbproject/`**: Standard NetBeans project metadata.

## How to Use/Run

Given that this is a Java project, likely an applet or a desktop application, here's how it could typically be run:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 17 or compatible, as indicated by `openjdk-17-jdk` in previous contexts, though the project itself might be older).
2.  **Build the Project**: If you have Apache Ant installed, you can navigate to the `MOTO6809Project` directory and run:
    ```bash
    ant
    ```
    This command will compile the Java source files and create the necessary build artifacts.
3.  **Run as Applet**: The `build/INSTRUCTION.html` file suggests it can be run as a Java Applet. You would typically open this HTML file in a web browser that supports Java Applets (though modern browsers have largely deprecated applet support due to security concerns). A more reliable way might be to use the `appletviewer` tool from the JDK:
    ```bash
    appletviewer build/INSTRUCTION.html
    ```
4.  **Run as Desktop Application (if applicable)**: If the `Moto.java` or `MOTO_INTERFACE.java` contains a `main` method, it might be runnable directly as a standalone Java application. After building, you could try:
    ```bash
    java -cp build/classes moto.Moto # Or moto.MOTO_INTERFACE
    ```
    (You might need to adjust the classpath and main class name based on the actual entry point).

## Potential Applications

This project could be used for:

*   **Education**: Teaching computer architecture, assembly language programming (specifically for Motorola 6809), and microprocessor fundamentals.
*   **Historical Computing**: Simulating vintage hardware for enthusiasts or researchers.
*   **Debugging/Development**: Providing a sandbox environment for writing and testing small 6809 assembly programs without needing physical hardware.

## Conclusion

The MOTO6809Project is a well-structured Java application that serves as a simulator for the Motorola 6809 microprocessor. Its design suggests a strong focus on providing a visual and interactive learning environment for assembly language and microprocessor architecture. While Java Applets are less common today, the core simulation logic remains valuable for educational and historical purposes.
